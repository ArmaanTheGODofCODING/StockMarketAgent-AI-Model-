Project goal
- Build a reproducible pipeline and model(s) to analyze and generate actionable signals for equities (stock-level and portfolio-level).
- Clarify scope: prediction horizon (intraday / daily / weekly / monthly), assets covered, and allowed actions (long-only, long/short, portfolio weights).

Data sources & freshness
- Price data: OHLCV (tick, minute, daily) from reliable providers (e.g., exchange feeds, Alpha Vantage, Tiingo, Polygon).
- Fundamentals: quarterly/annual financials, earnings, ratios.
- Alternative: news sentiment, macro series, economic calendars, options/vol implied vol, insider filings.
- Ensure timestamps are in UTC; maintain source provenance and update cadence.

Targets & labeling
- Define explicit targets: next-day return, T-day return, direction (up/down), event-driven response.
- Avoid look-ahead bias: use only information available at prediction timestamp.
- Provide classification and regression variants for different use cases.

Preprocessing & feature engineering
- Align multiple feeds to a single time index; resample as needed.
- Handle missing data: forward-fill only where justified; mark imputed data.
- Standard features: returns, log returns, rolling mean/volatility, RSI, MACD, SMA/EMA, ATR, VWAP, volume-weighted metrics.
- Fundamental features: normalized ratios, earnings surprise flags, momentum across fundamentals.
- Date/time features: day-of-week, month, earnings calendar proximity, market open/close flags.
- Cross-sectional features: z-score within sector/market cap buckets.

Train/validation/test split & CV
- Use time series aware splits (walk-forward / expanding window) — no random shuffles across time.
- Keep a realistic validation period that includes different market regimes.
- Reserve a final out-of-time test for simulated live performance.

Model choices & baselines
- Always implement simple baselines: historical mean, momentum rule, logistic regression.
- Tree-based models: LightGBM / XGBoost for tabular engineered features.
- Neural nets: 1D CNN, LSTM/GRU, Transformer models for raw sequences; be cautious of overfitting.
- Ensembles: stacking or blending of diverse models.
- Regularization, early stopping, and robust hyperparameter search (Bayesian, grid).

Evaluation metrics
- Prediction metrics: MAE, RMSE for regression; accuracy, AUC, precision/recall for classification.
- Trading metrics: cumulative return, CAGR, volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, Calmar ratio.
- Transaction metrics: turnover, average holding period, hit rate, P&L per trade.
- Use bootstrap or walk-forward backtests to estimate strategy confidence intervals.

Backtesting & realism
- Implement realistic execution: simulate transaction costs, slippage, market impact, liquidity constraints, and order types.
- Use per-symbol position limits, sector/portfolio constraints, and realistic leverage rules.
- Rebalance frequency aligned with prediction horizon.

Risk management & constraints
- Capital allocation rules, stop losses, position sizing (Kelly, fixed fraction), and diversification constraints.
- Stress-test strategies: regime shifts, crisis scenarios, outlier events.

Explainability & auditability
- Provide feature importance, partial dependence, and SHAP explanations.
- Log model inputs/outputs, random seeds, environment, and data snapshots to enable reproducibility.

Monitoring & production
- Data pipeline: validation, alerting on missing or anomalous feeds.
- Model monitoring: performance drift detection, PSI, weight drift, and periodic retrain triggers.
- Canary deployment or shadow-mode evaluation before live execution.

Compliance & ethics
- Document data licenses and usage restrictions.
- Avoid using non-public or proprietary insider information.
- Display clear user-facing disclaimers: models are probabilistic and not financial advice.

Reproducibility & experiment tracking
- Store experiments with hyperparameters, seeds, metrics, and artifacts (MLflow / Weights & Biases).
- Version-control code and data schema; snapshot training datasets.

Deliverables checklist
- Data ingestion scripts and schema docs.
- Feature engineering notebook and feature store exports.
- Baseline models + production-ready pipelines.
- Backtest engine with configurable costs and constraints.
- Monitoring dashboards and retraining plan.
- README with how to run, assumptions, and limitations.

Limitations & safety note
- Models do not guarantee future returns. Validate on out-of-sample data and monitor in production.
- Keep the human-in-loop for final trading decisions and risk overrides.

Implementation suggestions
- Start with daily OHLCV + simple momentum baseline; add features incrementally.
- Use walk-forward CV and record live-simulated P&L before real execution.
- Automate data validation tests and scheduled retraining.

Contact / ownership
- Assign dataset owner, feature owner, model owner, and deployment owner for accountability.
- Maintain a changelog for model and data updates.

NIFTY/SENSEX
-  Do tell about the NIFTY 50 and SENSEX stocks and their expected opening and closing.
