Purpose
- Provide concise rules and monitoring practices to identify poor-quality stocks and avoid/detect deteriorating positions.

Red flags (fundamental)
- Declining revenue and operating income across multiple quarters.
- Negative and falling free cash flow; cash from operations consistently below net income.
- Rapidly rising debt, deteriorating interest coverage, or covenant breaches.
- Repeated earnings misses and reliance on one-time/non-GAAP adjustments.
- Negative gross margin trends or shrinking operating margins vs peers.
- Large dilution: frequent secondary offerings or convertible issuance.
- Repeated restatements, auditor resignation or material weaknesses in controls.
- Low Piotroski F-score, low Altman Z-score, high Beneish M-score (possible manipulation).

Red flags (corporate governance / behavior)
- Frequent CEO/CFO turnover, related-party transactions, and insider selling concentration.
- Opaque disclosures or delayed SEC filings (10-Q/10-K/8-K).
- Management guidance that consistently revises downward.

Red flags (market/technical/liquidity)
- Extremely low average daily volume / wide bid-ask spreads (hard to exit).
- Persistent extreme volatility, large unexplained block trades.
- Short interest spikes or borrow unavailability (if long exposure).
- Price breakdown below major support and failure to recover.

Quantitative checks & metrics to compute
- FCF / Revenue, CFO / Net Income, Debt / EBITDA, Interest Coverage.
- Trailing and forward P/E vs sector, EV/EBITDA, Price / Sales.
- Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, Beneish M-score, accruals ratio.
- Rolling return correlations and sector-relative z-scores.

Monitoring checklist (automated)
- Real-time alerts for: insider sales, 8-K filings, earnings misses, auditor changes.
- Volume/price anomaly detection (e.g., volume > 3x 20-day average).
- News sentiment surge and regulatory/legal headlines.
- Options unusual activity (e.g., large puts bought) and short-interest changes.

Operational responses when flag triggered
- Triage: confirm data quality and check primary filings/news.
- Reduce position size or set tighter stop-loss; implement hedges (options or sector short).
- Pause algorithmic signals for that ticker; require manual review.
- Flag for deeper forensic accounting review if M-score/ restatements appear.
- If liquidity risk high, stagger exits to avoid market impact.

Backtesting & validation
- Backtest "avoid" rules and cut logic with transaction costs and market impact.
- Measure false positives and missed-losses: cost of selling vs holding.
- Simulate escapes under low-liquidity scenarios.

Data sources & tooling
- Price/volume: exchange/APIs (Polygon, Tiingo, AlphaVantage).
- Filings/news: SEC EDGAR, News APIs, RSS feeds.
- Accounting metrics: standardize GAAP fields; track non-GAAP adjustments.
- Use alerting (email/Slack), dashboards, and automated checks.

Governance & compliance
- Log signals, trigger reasons, and manual review outcomes for auditability.
- Document assumptions; include clear disclaimers that this is not financial advice.
