1. Data Collection
Gather real-time and historical market data:

Stock prices, volumes, and volatility

Company fundamentals (earnings, revenue, debt, cash flow)

Macroeconomic indicators (interest rates, inflation, GDP growth)

Sector and industry trends

Integrate news sentiment analysis (positive/negative coverage, analyst opinions).

2. Feature Engineering
Compute financial ratios:

P/E ratio, P/B ratio, Debt-to-Equity, ROE, ROA

Track momentum indicators:

Moving averages, RSI, MACD

Assess risk metrics:

Beta (market correlation), Sharpe ratio, volatility index

3. Classification Logic
Define criteria for “good” stocks:

Strong fundamentals (consistent revenue/earnings growth)

Positive sentiment and analyst upgrades

Healthy balance sheet and low debt

Outperforming peers in the same sector

Define criteria for “bad” stocks:

Declining revenues or negative earnings

High debt burden or poor cash flow

Negative sentiment/news (lawsuits, scandals, poor management)

Underperforming sector benchmarks

4. Model Techniques
Machine Learning Approaches:

Supervised classification (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting)

Neural networks for pattern recognition in time-series data

Unsupervised Approaches:

Clustering stocks into “strong,” “neutral,” and “weak” groups

Hybrid Approaches:

Combine fundamental + technical + sentiment signals

5. Output & Recommendations
Provide stock ratings (e.g., Buy, Hold, Sell).

Flag risk levels (low, medium, high).

Generate explanations:

Why a stock is classified as “good” or “bad” (e.g., “Strong earnings growth, low debt” vs. “Declining revenue, negative sentiment”).

6. Limitations & Safeguards
Model should not guarantee profits—only highlight probabilities.

Must update continuously with new data.

Include risk disclaimers: market conditions can change rapidly.
