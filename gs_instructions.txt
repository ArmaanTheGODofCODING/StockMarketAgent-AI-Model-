- Positive and growing free cash flow; cash generation exceeds capital needs.
- Sustainable margins and improving unit economics versus peers.
- Strong returns on capital (ROIC, ROE) and efficient capital allocation.
- Healthy balance sheet: manageable leverage, strong interest coverage, ample liquidity.
- Durable competitive advantage (moat), predictable customer demand, diversified revenue.
- Transparent disclosures, stable and aligned management, insider buying preferred.
- Adequate liquidity and orderly market behavior for practical execution.

Quantitative checks
- Revenue and EPS CAGR (3–5 years) above sector median.

- ROIC > WACC and ROIC consistently positive.
- Debt / EBITDA below defined threshold for sector.
- Piotroski F-score high; Altman Z-score comfortable.
- Positive momentum: price > 50/200-day MA, strong relative strength vs index.

Qualitative checks
- Clear business model and unit economics.
- Repeatable sales motion, high customer retention or switching costs.
- Reasonable valuation relative to growth (PEG, EV/EBITDA vs peers).
- Management with track record of shareholder-friendly capital allocation.

Technical & liquidity filters
- Average daily volume sufficient to enter/exit positions without undue market impact.
- Price in a confirmed uptrend or constructive base with controlled volatility.

Watchlist & monitoring
- Track earnings beats/misses, guidance changes, product launches, regulatory news.
- Alerts for insider sales/buys, significant insider options exercise.
- Volume anomalies, downgrades, and sector leadership shifts.
- Recompute key ratios after each quarterly filing.

Buy rules & position sizing
- Entry signals: trend continuation, confirmed breakout, high-quality pullback to support.
- Scale in on strength or valuation improvement; avoid averaging down into fundamental deterioration.
- Position size by risk: volatility-adjusted size and portfolio concentration caps.
- Use defined stop-losses or bearish hedge to protect capital on thesis failure.

Exit criteria
- Deterioration in core fundamentals (growth, margins, cash flow).
- Management or governance red flags.
- Valuation reaches target or stock materially outperforms peers and risk/reward flips.
- Liquidity or market structure changes that impede execution.

Backtesting & validation

- Validate across regimes and perform walk-forward testing.
- Track metrics: CAGR, Sharpe, max drawdown, hit rate, average holding period.

Operationalize & governance
- Maintain audit logs for signals, triggers, and manual overrides.
